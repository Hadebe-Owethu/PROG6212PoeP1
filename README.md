We're building a front-end prototype for the Contract Monthly Claim System (CMCS) using ASP.NET Core MVC. The goal is to design a clean, user-friendly interface where lecturers can submit monthly claims, coordinators can review and approve them, and admins can view summaries. We're not implementing backend logicâ€”just focusing on Razor Views, controller stubs, and model classes to simulate the structure and flow of a real application.
